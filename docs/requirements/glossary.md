# Domain Glossary

One definition per term, used consistently across the team. Add terms as modules are specified.

## IAM

- **Organisation** — The top of the structure; one per deployment. Parent of all companies.
- **Company** — A legal entity within the organisation. Scoping parent of company-bound master data
  and transactions (`company_id`). A deployment may have several.
- **Branch** — A physical location (shop, depot, warehouse) under a company. Smallest unit at which
  stock and a business day exist. Identified by a `code` unique within its company.
- **Default branch (of a company)** — The branch used as a company's fallback context.
- **App user / user** — A login identity. Distinct from an *employee* (an HR record). A user may or
  may not be an employee. Logs in with a **username** (unique org-wide).
- **Branch assignment** — A link making a user "present" at a branch (`user_branch`). A user has
  many; exactly one is the user's **default branch**.
- **Default branch (of a user)** — The single branch a user lands in at login. Must be one of the
  user's current assignments. Auto-promoted to the earliest-assigned branch if removed.
- **Default company (of a user)** — The company a user lands in at login (the company of their
  default branch). Relevant because a user may span companies.
- **Permission** — The atomic access unit, a dot-separated code (`USER.MANAGE`). Org-wide catalogue,
  seeded. Authorisation checks reference permission codes, never role names.
- **Role** — A named, reusable bundle of permissions (`CASHIER`, `BRANCH_MANAGER`). Org-wide.
- **Role assignment (`user_role`)** — Binds a role to a user, scoped to a company and optionally to
  one branch. Branch unset ⇒ all branches of that company the user is assigned to.
- **Super-admin / root** — An identity that transcends company/branch scoping for administration and
  recovery. Bootstrap-created, tightly held, fully audited.
- **Bootstrap** — The env-driven first-run process that creates organisation + first company +
  default branch + root admin on an empty database. No interactive wizard.
- **Branch-override header** — The request header by which an authenticated user switches their
  active branch without re-login. Honoured only for branches the user is assigned to and whose role
  scope covers them.
- **Access token / refresh token** — Short-lived JWT (15 min) used per request; longer-lived refresh
  token (7 days, single-use rotated) used to obtain a new pair.
- **Lockout** — Temporary block after 5 consecutive failed logins (15 minutes); admin can clear.

## Terminology rulings (pick one, stay consistent)
- Use **user** (not "account") for the login identity; "account" only when discussing lockout state.
- Use **company** for the legal entity, **branch** for the location — never interchangeably.
- Use **permission** (not "privilege" or "right") for the atomic access unit.
